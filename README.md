# üß¨ Treg Foxp3 Degradation ‚Äî High-Throughput Genomics Analysis

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and associated datasets for the comprehensive analysis of **regulatory T cells (Tregs)** undergoing **acute Foxp3 degradation**, across diverse biological contexts. Leveraging both **single-cell** and **bulk RNA-sequencing** technologies, these analyses uncover dynamic transcriptional changes following the targeted loss of *Foxp3*, a master regulator of Treg identity and function.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into **single-cell** and **bulk transcriptomics** components, each addressing a distinct experimental context.

### üî¨ Single-Cell RNA-seq Analyses

These notebooks explore the cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional dynamics of Tregs following Foxp3 degradation:

- **Foxp3 Degradation in Adult Secondary Lymphoid Organs (SLO)**  
  - `scrna-filter-d0.ipynb`  
  - `scrna-postfilter.ipynb`

- **Foxp3 Degradation Across Multiple Organs**  
  - `scrna-organ.ipynb`

- **Foxp3 Degradation in the Tumor Microenvironment**  
  - `scrna-tumor.ipynb`

- **Foxp3 Degradation in Adoptive Transfer Settings**  
  - `scrna-transfer.ipynb`

---

### üß™ Bulk RNA-seq Analyses

Bulk RNA-seq analyses include both newly generated and reanalyzed datasets:

- `bulk_rna_data/`  
  Contains gene expression matrices, differential expression analyses, and metadata relevant to Foxp3 degradation experiments.

---

## üí° Purpose

The goal of this project is to dissect the downstream consequences of **acute Foxp3 loss** in Tregs, with a focus on:

- Loss of Treg identity  
- Emergence of effector-like transcriptional programs  
- Tissue- and context-specific regulatory rewiring  
- Implications for tumor immunity and autoimmunity

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To run the notebooks, ensure you have a Python environment with the following key packages:

- `scanpy`
- `anndata`
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

We recommend setting up a virtual environment using `venv` or `conda` to manage dependencies.
